  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of the computational efficiency of an algorithm. It describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to the size of the input. Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms that perform well on large datasets.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. It is an important factor when working with memory-constrained systems. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory that scales linearly with the size of the input.
