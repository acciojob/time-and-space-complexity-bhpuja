	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time Complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to precess or run as a function of the amount of input. In other words, time complexity is essentially, or how long a program function takes of process a given input.

	      <b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of space or memory taken by an  algorithm or a program to run as a function of the length of the input. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by the input. It's commoly expressed as O(n).
